# Project description

## _This project was done whereby the data provided by TMDB._

- React
- Redux
- TypeScript
- SASS

were used in the aforementioned project. I tried to introduce more functionality, than TMDB provides. Let’s go deeper into the functional aspects...

### Go deeper

When the page first opens, it offers films, trailers and latest movies generally. Scrolling horizontally, you will again notice the data (Apropos, the data appears from API while scrolling).

Rating round are available in pictures related to movies. These are also redirected from API. Yet, the round detail representing percentage is a separate component, which you can find and use as needed from my page.

#### Clicking on the pictures

Clicking on the pictures, we find ourselves in a new page, where detailed information, movie cast, as well as trailers are at hand.

In the other component, we can watch movie trailers. While hovering the background converts to the movie pic. A click opens the “trailer component”, where all the trailers are available to watch. Let me remind you each component has two buttons, that comprise relevant data.

Unlike the TMDB page, the project is not only mobile friendly, but also adapted for any dimension.
